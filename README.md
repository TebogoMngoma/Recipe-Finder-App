A responsive Recipe Finder App using React and Vite. The app features a modern glassmorphism design, smooth animations with framer-motion, and integration with the Spoonacular API (with a seamless mock data fallback).

Changes Made
UI/UX Design
Modern Aesthetics: Implemented a dark theme with glassmorphism effects, gradient text, and a vibrant orange/yellow color palette.
Glassmorphism Navbar: A blurred, transparent navbar with a custom logo and navigation links.
Hero Section: A high-impact hero area with a smooth entrance animation and a centralized search bar.
Recipe Cards: Animated cards showing recipe images, health scores, and preparation times. Includes hover effects and staggered entrance.
Micro-animations: Used framer-motion for page transitions, card hover effects, and modal popups.
Features
Search System: Search for any recipe. The app filters results in real-time.
Mock Data Fallback: In the absence of an API key, the app remains fully functional using a set of curated mock recipes.
Recipe Details Modal: Clicking on any recipe opens a detailed modal with descriptions and key features.
Responsive Layout: The app is designed to look great on desktop and mobile screens.
